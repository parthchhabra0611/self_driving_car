# self_driving_car

The project is based on lane detection and navigation using opencv and python. 

It requires a small car with camera and raspberry pi along with batteries to power the wheels.
The track on which the car moves can be designed with black chart paper and white curved and straight strips of paper.

The code might require modification based on your needs and the track but still it provides a good baseline for starting a project on self driving cars.
